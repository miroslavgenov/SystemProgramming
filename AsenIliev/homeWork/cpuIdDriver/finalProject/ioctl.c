    A call to open() creates a new open file description, an entry in
       the system-wide table of open files.  The open file description
       records the file offset and the file status flags (see below).  A
       file descriptor is a reference to an open file description; this
       reference is unaffected if pathname is subsequently removed or
       modified to refer to a different file.  For further details on
       open file descriptions, see NOTES.

          The argument flags must include one of the following access
       modes: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR.  These request opening the
       file read-only, write-only, or read/write, respectively.

        ioctl is a system call that acts on a file
        descriptor; it receives a number that identifies a command to be performed and
        (optionally) another argument, usually a pointer.
        
        These commands can copy relevant data structures from the driver to user space where you
        can examine them.

        The dots in the prototype represent
            not a variable number of arguments but a single optional argument, traditionally
            identified as char *argp.

            The actual nature of the third argument depends on the specific con-
trol command being issued (the second argument). Some commands take no argu-
ments, some take an integer value, and some take a pointer to other data. Using a
pointer is the way to pass arbitrary data to the ioctl call; the device is then able to
exchange any amount of data with user space.
